                            Red-tagging is an issue that hits close to home for any UP student. Chad Booc, a graduate of our department and an alumnus of UP CURSOR, is a famous victim. The circumstances surrounding his death are particularly polarizing. While many condemned the state for his death, quite a few still lauded the government for its actions, an indication of the success of the state's red-tagging. Our frustration regarding this, and the inherent dangers of red-tagging, lead us to choose this issue as the focus of our CS 132 project.

                        <p>Twitter has become a prominent platform for red-taggers to spread disinformation and target activists like Chad Booc. The ease with which information can be disseminated on Twitter means that disinformation can quickly gain traction and be amplified, leading to potentially severe consequences for targeted individuals and movements. These consequences include defamation, harassment, or even death, like in Chad Booc's case.

                            Through this project, we aim to be able to analyze the behavior and intent of red taggers on Twitter and identify their patterns of red-tagging. Through this, we can gain a better understanding on how red-taggers operate which can be helpful as a reference for combatting this kind of disinformation in the future.

                    <p>
                        With this set of keywords, we were able to collect a majority of tweets from 2022 that red-tagged Chad Booc and Lumad schools.

From this, we used a 7-day moving average to help find time intervals with a high number of tweets. We then used this (excluding intervals with 0 tweets) to identify outliers, which we defined as 7-day intervals with a number of tweets that is 1.5 IQRs above Q3.

                        To get only important words and concepts in the tweets, a list of English stopwords is used to filter the words present in the tweet. This removes unnecessary words such as articles and pronouns in the content of the tweet. Then, NLTK's word_tokenize() function is used to get the tokenised words to prepare for the next steps.

                        To get the common topics found across the gathered tweets, it is important that the content in each are in the same form. This is done by stemming and lemmatising the words. Stemming is done using NLTK's PorterStemmer class, while lemmatisation is done using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer class.present in the same form. This is done by stemming and lemmatising the words.

                After these preprocessing procedures, we can get the top keywords used in the tweets:

                        In order to group the tweets by date, pandas' resample method is used. A moving average is also computed using pandas' rolling method is used with a window size of 7 to show weekly trends in the data.

                We now have the time series data for the number of tweets per day. The red bars are the number of tweets per day. The blue line is the 7-day moving average. The green line is the boundary from which we consider a time interval to be an outlier.
