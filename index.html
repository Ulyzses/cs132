                            Red-tagging is an issue that hits close to home for any UP student. Chad Booc, a graduate of our department and an alumnus of UP CURSOR, is a famous victim. The circumstances surrounding his death are particularly polarizing. While many condemned the state for his death, quite a few still lauded the government for its actions, an indication of the success of the state's red-tagging. Our frustration regarding this, and the inherent dangers of red-tagging, lead us to choose this issue as the focus of our CS 132 project.

                        <p>Twitter has become a prominent platform for red-taggers to spread disinformation and target activists like Chad Booc. The ease with which information can be disseminated on Twitter means that disinformation can quickly gain traction and be amplified, leading to potentially severe consequences for targeted individuals and movements. These consequences include defamation, harassment, or even death, like in Chad Booc's case.

                        To get only important words and concepts in the tweets, a list of English stopwords is used to filter the words present in a tweet. This removes unnecessary words such as articles and pronouns in the content of the tweet. NLTK corpus' stopwords is used for this, which we extended to include additional words such as meaningless expressions. Then, NLTK's word_tokenize function is used to get the tokenised words to prepare for the next steps.

                        To get the common topics found across the gathered tweets, it is important that the content in each are in the same form. This is done by lemmatising the tokenised words using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer. The help of NLTK's post_tag is employed to determine each word's part of speech for a more accurate lemmatisation.

                        The cluster predominantly talking about his death is one of the clusters that had the highest number of tweets, we were unable to find a statistically significant difference on the amount in that cluster versus the others (χ2 = 1.96, p = 0.05). Using LDA, we were able to group the tweets into four clusters. The cluster of tweets predominantly talking about Chad Booc's death made up 27.46% of the total.

                    We have identified several dates with distinct patterns of tweet frequency and corresponding characteristics. These are: February 25, the day of Chad Booc's death, March 12, Leni's Isabella rally and Inquirer's article release on Chad's autopsy, and July 26, PBBM's SONA. Furthermore, topic clustering showed that tweets are uniformly distributed across four topics: (1) Lumad schools as NPA training grounds, (2) red-tagging of Makabayan bloc and Filipino activists, (3) Chad Booc's death, and (4) Chad being red-tagged as an NPA member. 
                </p>  
            </div>
            <p class="section-description">
                From the results, we conclude that the frequency of tweets red-tagging Chad Booc and his activities significantly increased after his death, but these tweets did not predominantly talk about his death.
