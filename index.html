                            Red-tagging is an issue that hits close to home for any UP student. Chad Booc, a graduate of our department and an alumnus of UP CURSOR, is a famous victim. The circumstances surrounding his death are particularly polarizing. While many condemned the state for his death, quite a few still lauded the government for its actions, an indication of the success of the state's red-tagging. Our frustration regarding this, and the inherent dangers of red-tagging, lead us to choose this issue as the focus of our CS 132 project.

                        <p>Twitter has become a prominent platform for red-taggers to spread disinformation and target activists like Chad Booc. The ease with which information can be disseminated on Twitter means that disinformation can quickly gain traction and be amplified, leading to potentially severe consequences for targeted individuals and movements. These consequences include defamation, harassment, or even death, like in Chad Booc's case.

                            Through this project, we aim to be able to analyze the behavior and intent of red taggers on Twitter and identify their patterns of red-tagging. Through this, we can gain a better understanding on how red-taggers operate which can be helpful as a reference for combatting this kind of disinformation in the future.
