                    <p>
                        Red-tagging is an issue that hits close to home for any UP student. Chad Booc, a graduate of our department and an alumnus of UP CURSOR, is a famous victim. The circumstances surrounding his death are a particularly polarizing topic. While many condemned the state for his death, many still lauded the government for its actions. We observed many Tweets that red-tagged Chad and portrayed him as a terrorist. Our frustration regarding this, and the inherent dangers of red-tagging, lead us to choose this issue as the focus of our CS 132 project.

                        Problem
                    </h3>
                    <p>Twitter has become a prominent platform for red-taggers to spread disinformation and target activists like Chad Booc. The ease with which information can be disseminated on Twitter means that disinformation can quickly gain traction and be amplified, leading to potentially severe consequences for targeted individuals and movements. These consequences include defamation, harassment, or even death, like in Chad Boocâ€™s case.

                        Solution
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The use of disinformation by red-taggers can make it hard to properly refute their arguments. Through this project, we will be able to analyze the behavior and intent of red taggers on Twitter and identify patterns of red-tagging. Through this, we can gain a better understanding of how red-taggers operate which can be helpful as a reference for combatting disinformation.
